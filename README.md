# Science on Twitter
### What are the most popular Arxiv papers on Twitter? 

To find out what is hot right now, this code listens to the stream of Twitter statuses with keyword 'arxiv'- [www.Arxiv.org](www.Arxiv.org) is a popular open library of scientific papers on many topics- and gathers links to the scientific papers.

There are three steps to that process:
 - Gathering data: arxiv_tweets_get_data.ipynb
 - Processing data: arxiv_tweets_datacrunch.ipynb
 - Visualising data: arxiv_tweets_visualsiation.ipynb

If you are interested in the results, I recommend looking at the arxiv_tweets_visualisation notebook. Gathered data can be found in the data subdirectory. For convenience you can also find here a python version of the data gathering notebook.

**WARNING** : If you want to run arxiv_tweets_get_data.ipynb yourself, you will have to supply your own Twitter API acces keys (link to tutorial included in the notebook)

**Data gathering is still under process**
